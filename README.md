- Stunting is the highest impact of malnutrition in West Africa.
- Of the 16 countries in West Africa, Niger has the highest rate of malnutrition inWest Africa. This could be because it is a landlocked country, as it affects traderoutes and food imports.
- Although Cabo Verde has the lowest malnutrition rate in the region, food insecurity is still a concern in the country
